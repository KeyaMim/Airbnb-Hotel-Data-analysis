# Airbnb-Hotel-Data-analysis
This Excel dashboard explores Airbnb hotel data to uncover patterns and trends. I analyzed channel performance, revenue & loss over time, cancellation trends, average daily rates, and booking patterns by lead time.

The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing you to filter by channel or date to explore performance instantly. It highlights key trends and insights, showing which channels perform best and how revenue, cancellations, and bookings vary.

Working on this project was exciting because it allowed me to see hidden patterns in the data and present them clearly and visually.
