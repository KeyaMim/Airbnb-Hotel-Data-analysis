# Airbnb-Hotel-Data-analysis
This Excel dashboard explores Airbnb hotel data to uncover patterns and trends. I analyzed channel performance, bookings, cancellations, revenue, and daily rates over time.

The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing you to filter by channel or date to instantly explore performance. It turns raw data into actionable insights and visually highlights key trends, helping understand which channels are performing best and how bookings and revenue fluctuate over time.

Working on this project was exciting because it allowed me to uncover insights hidden in the data and present them in a clear, easy-to-understand way.
